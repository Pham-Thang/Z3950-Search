TODO list 

* testing with threading 
  need to write test cases where syncronous connections to same server 
  and to different servers are made to check that code is stabile for
  threading issues.  

* CCL parsing support and CCL->RPN client side converter
  see 
  http://www.indexdata.dk/yaz/doc/tools.tkl#tools.query
  for ideas

* eventually CQL parsing support and CQL->RPN client side converter

* NDoc/Doxygen documentation
  Essentially, nice HTML source code docs and Windows VS source docs
  are needed. Ideally, NDoc and/or Doxygen can be used to extract the
  same source code documentation into HTML and/or Windows VS format.  

  Missing: factories and IPrefixQuery

* MS .NET packaging
  NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) might be a good and easy
  solution. We have packaged YAZ with it before, and it just works.
  http://nsis.sourceforge.net/

* GNU/Linux Debian packaging
  Standard debian package following the 
  CIL packaging policy
  http://pkg-mono.alioth.debian.org/cli-policy/index.html

* Check compile on ADM64 platform, there might be a problem with 
  size_t (64 bit) and uint (32 bit). Might be better to use 
  UIntPtr in Yaz.cs ?? Seems  to work correctly on ADM 64 Debian
